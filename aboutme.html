      <p>After my undergrad, I started a masters program for teaching. Although I ultimately decided that teaching was not for me, I learned many invaluable things from my program. In relation to design, students are like the various users that might use our product and I kept my students in mind as I prepped materials. How can I reach this student and how can I push that student through my lessons. Each detail, from lesson planning down to the organization of seats was designed to help my students excel. Each learner is different and need teachers who sit down and think about ways they can improve the system for their students. For example, studies show that simply integrating technology into the lesson is not sufficient, teachers need to plan out how that technology would supplement their teaching in order for it to be effective. I believe that lasting impact can be made in the classrooms and that is why I think design is essential as a teacher. </p>
      <br>
      <p>In this era technology is being integrated into the education system, we can influence students positively in the classroom with excellent design. I am personally still very passionate about education and I hope to impact the classroom as a designer. There are many kids who are at a disadvantage when they start school, I want to bridge the gap between students using well designed, intuitive programs. Many teachers have implemented a flipped classroom model where students learn through videos at home and collaborate on work during class time. Collaboration is key to an effective learning environment and this creates a space for thoughtful design that aids students in communicating and working together. There are so many opportunities that technology can provide for the classroom and I want to be part of that group pushing the boundaries for those students.
